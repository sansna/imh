Before Compiling
=
Modify the source file, the path referenced in *main.cpp* is not always 
right for running it correctly.

Compile
=
Windows
-
To use mingw is suggested.. not supporting C11, so using nmake would 
causing compiling errors.

    make

Unix
-
Using the default make to generate the executable.

    make

Run
=
Windows
-
    app.exe

Unix
-
    ./app

Enjoy!!
